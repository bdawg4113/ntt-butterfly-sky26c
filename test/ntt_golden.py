ntt_golden.py -- bit-exact golden model for the ML-KEM-512 NTT/INTT accelerator.

This mirrors the hardware exactly, in the arithmetic the textbook derives:

  * coefficients are SIGNED and centred, carried as 16-bit values
  * the twiddle table is stored in Montgomery form (zeta^brv7(k) * R mod q)
  * the butterfly multiply is fqmul = montgomery_reduce(a*b)   -- Theorem 6.1
  * range control after addition chains is barrett_reduce      -- Theorem 6.2

Both reductions are on the chip, and they are not alternatives. The textbook's
division of labour: Montgomery after every multiply, because a multiply is
where the R bookkeeping is free; Barrett to tidy up after chains of additions,
where no R factor is involved and the value simply needs to come back in range.

Constants are checked against the reference Kyber tables, and both theorems'
bounds are checked exhaustively, in the self-test at the bottom of this file.
