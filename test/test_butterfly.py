# test_butterfly.py -- the six-operation datapath, over both reductions.
#
# One pipelined multiplier and one Barrett reducer serve CT, GS, FQMUL, ZMUL,
# BARRETT and ADD, so the failure mode to hunt is cross-talk: a mux that leaks
# the forward transform's post-multiply subtract into the inverse's output, or a
# Barrett input that stays wired to the GS sum when the standalone BARRETT op
# runs. The tests therefore interleave the ops rather than running each in a
# clean block.
#
# Two latencies live here. CT, GS, FQMUL and ZMUL occupy the multiplier and take
# three clocks; BARRETT and ADD are combinational and answer immediately. That
# is deliberate -- it is the whole reason a standalone Barrett unit was worth
# the area -- and test_each_op pins both down.
