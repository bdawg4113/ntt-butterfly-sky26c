## How it works

This chip is the **modular arithmetic engine** of the Number Theoretic Transform used by **ML-KEM-512**
(FIPS 203, formerly Kyber). It carries **both reduction kernels** — Montgomery and Barrett — and the
**128-entry twiddle table** on die.

A host — an **Arty A7 FPGA** — holds the 256-coefficient polynomial and walks the address pattern. The chip
does the arithmetic and looks up its own constants: the host sends a twiddle **index**, never a value.

All values are **signed 16-bit** and centred; the modulus is **q = 3329** and the Montgomery radix is
**R = 2¹⁶**.

### Both reductions, and the division of labour

Every butterfly needs a multiply *and* a reduction mod q, and a hardware divider is out of the question. Two
classic tricks replace the division with multiplies and shifts — and they are **not alternatives**. Each does
the job the other is bad at.

**Montgomery reduction** (Theorem 6.1) takes a signed 32-bit product and returns `a·R⁻¹ mod q` with `|t| < q`:

```
m = (a mod± R) · QINV        QINV = q⁻¹ mod 2¹⁶ = -3327
t = (a - m·q) / R
```

`m` is chosen precisely so that `m·q` matches `a` in the low 16 bits, which makes the division by R exact — a
wire, not a divider. It also means the subtraction cannot borrow out of those bits, so in hardware it collapses
to a **16-bit** subtract of the two top halves. No 32-bit subtractor exists on the die.

**Barrett reduction** (Theorem 6.2) takes a signed 16-bit value and returns a centred representative in
`(-q/2, q/2]`:

```
v = ⌊(2²⁶ + q/2)/q⌋ = 20159
t = ⌊(a·v + 2²⁵)/2²⁶⌋
barrett(a) = a - t·q
```

`v/2²⁶` approximates `1/q` closely enough that `t` is *exactly* `round(a/q)`, which is what makes the remainder
centred rather than merely bounded. The `2²⁵` term is what turns a floor into a round; without it every
negative input would come back one `q` low.

**Which goes where.** Montgomery runs after every *multiply*, because a multiply is where the R bookkeeping is
free: the twiddle carries a factor R, the product cancels it, and the reduction rides inside the multiplier's
own pipeline. Barrett runs after chains of *additions*, where no R factor is involved and the value simply
needs to come back into range. Gentleman-Sande adds `a` and `b` every layer with no multiply on that path, so
without a reducer the sum grows layer over layer until it overflows 16 bits.

That split is what makes the inverse transform cost **one** multiply per butterfly instead of two. Reusing
`fqmul(x, R mod q)` for range reduction is arithmetically sound and was what an earlier revision did — it
occupies the multiplier for a second pass on every GS butterfly. A dedicated Barrett unit buys that back.

### The Montgomery domain

Montgomery does not return `a mod q`; it returns `a·R⁻¹ mod q`. The fix (Key Idea 6.1) is to keep everything in
the **Montgomery domain**: the twiddle table is stored pre-multiplied by R, so `fqmul(ζ·R, x) = ζ·x` arrives
with no stray factor. The on-chip table is therefore bit-identical to the reference Kyber `zetas` array,
beginning `-1044, -758, -359, -1517`.

A table of *plain* zetas (`1, 1729, 2580, 3289…`) is the same width and the same shape and is wrong here: it
would synthesise and simulate happily and produce a transform off by a factor of R at every butterfly.
`test_twiddle_rom.py` pins `ζ[1] = -758` explicitly so that substitution cannot pass unnoticed.

### Why the multiplier is pipelined

Written combinationally, `fqmul` chains **three multipliers** back to back: the 16×16 product, then `·QINV`,
then `·q`. That is roughly 120 gate levels in sky130, or 12–18 ns — against a 20 ns period, a margin of
1.1–1.6×, which is none at all once place-and-route adds wire delay.

Two rules set the stage boundaries. The first is obvious: **one multiply per stage**. The second was learned
from two failed builds, and it is the one that actually mattered.

> **No register may drive both a long path and a short path.** The placer cannot satisfy both. It pads the
> net to protect hold on the short path, and the long path pays. Post-layout, one such net carried **4.18 ns**
> of `clkdlybuf` delay before a single gate of arithmetic ran, and 227 hold-repair buffers existed across the
> design.

`fqmul` is five stages. Stage 0 exists only to obey the second rule: it latches the operands so the multiplier
array starts from registers whose sole job is to feed it, with no control net in front of it.

| stage | work | levels |
| ----- | ---- | ------ |
| 0 | latch operands | — |
| 1 | `pp_hi ← a·b_hi`, `pp_lo ← a·b_lo` — two 16×8 | 46 |
| 2 | `p ← (pp_hi << 8) + pp_lo` | 41 |
| 3 | `m ← p_lo·QINV`, with `p[31:16]` carried | 17 |
| 4 | `c ← p_hi − (m·q)[31:16]` | 47 |

Splitting the 16×16 array is what stage 1 and 2 are for: measured alone it is **63 levels**, too deep for a
20 ns period once buffering is added. Since `a·b = a·b_hi·256 + a·b_lo` with `b_hi` signed and `b_lo`
unsigned, two 16×8 products in parallel plus a shift and an add replace it at 46 levels.

Barrett is **two** stages, for the second rule rather than the first. Its input `a` reached the output twice:
through both constant multiplies, and **directly** into the final subtract `c = a − t·q`. One net, a 15 ns
path and a 1 ns path.

| stage | work | levels |
| ----- | ---- | ------ |
| 1 | `t ← (a·v + 2²⁵) >>> 26`, with `a` carried in its own register | 38 |
| 2 | `c ← a_r − t·q` | 29 |

`t` is declared **6 bits**, not 16. Since `|t| ≤ 10` for `|a| < 2¹⁵`, the obvious 16-bit declaration would make
`t·q` a 16×12 constant multiply instead of a 6×12 one, and cost three levels for nothing.

Every op takes **5 clocks**, `BARRETT` and `ADD` included, which also removed a special case from the front
end. Barrett finishes in three and its result is simply held until the outputs are read.

### Operating modes

`ctrl[2:0]` selects the operation; `ctrl[3]` is `zneg`, which negates the twiddle.

| op | name | `a_out` | `b_out` | muls | used for |
| -- | ---- | ------- | ------- | ---- | -------- |
| 0 | CT | `a + fqmul(ζ,b)` | `a − fqmul(ζ,b)` | 1 | forward NTT |
| 1 | GS | `barrett(a + b)` | `fqmul(ζ, b − a)` | 1 | inverse NTT |
| 2 | FQMUL | `fqmul(a, b)` | same | 1 | scaling, basemul |
| 3 | ZMUL | `fqmul(ζ, a)` | same | 1 | basemul's twiddle multiply |
| 4 | BARRETT | `barrett(a)` | same | 0 | range control |
| 5 | ADD | `a + b` | `a − b` | 0 | polynomial add/subtract |

`FQMUL` with `b = 1` is a bare `montgomery_reduce`, which is how the host strips the residual Montgomery
factor after a round trip. `ZMUL` with `zneg` is what keeps the table on chip for `basemul`, whose twiddles are
the signed pair `±zetas[64+i]`.

### Where the silicon goes

| block | cells | share |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| `fqmul` incl. Montgomery | 2,318 | 47.8% |
| `barrett_reduce` | 1,182 | 24.4% |
| `butterfly` muxing | 712 | 14.7% |
| `twiddle_rom` | 463 | 9.6% |
| `ntt_io` | 172 | 3.5% |
| **total** | **4,848** | |

That is the synthesis estimate. **Place and route measured 6,067 cells and 52,731 µm²**, or 72.7% of a 2x2
tile's core, the rest being timing repair buffers, clock tree and tap cells the flow adds after synthesis.
Carrying both reductions and a signed 16-bit datapath is what took this from the previous 2,756-cell build.

The design **closes 50 MHz**: worst setup slack `+1.955 ns` at `ss_100C_1v60` with zero violations at all nine
corners, hold `+0.106 ns`, and DRC, LVS, antenna and inferred latch counts all zero. Total power is
**2.623 mW**. The implied maximum frequency at the slow corner is 55.4 MHz.

The arithmetic is **72%** of the design. That is the inverse of the FPGA result, where the multipliers were
hard DSP blocks costing 5% of an Arty and 0.13% of a U55C, and it is the single biggest difference between
the two targets.

**On memory.** This shuttle offers no SRAM macro, so any array declared in the RTL becomes flip-flops and
their read multiplexers. The 256-coefficient polynomial would be 4,096 flip-flops, which no tile can hold, so
the host keeps it and the chip does the arithmetic. The design contains **no macros at all**: the flow
reports `design__instance__area__macros = 0`, and all 6,067 instances are standard cells.

## How to test

Operands and results are wider than the pin budget, so the host assembles operands by **addressed byte
writes**, pulses `start`, then shifts the result back out.

### Writing operands

Put a byte on `ui_in[7:0]`, its register number on `uio_in[2:0]`, and raise `uio_in[3]` (`we`):

| addr | register | | addr | register |
| ---- | -------- | - | ---- | -------- |
| 0 | `a[7:0]` | | 4 | `k` = twiddle index `[6:0]` |
| 1 | `a[15:8]` | | 5 | `ctrl = { 4'b0, zneg, op[2:0] }` |
| 2 | `b[7:0]` | | 6, 7 | reserved |
| 3 | `b[15:8]` | | | |

Registers persist between operations, so a host walking one NTT block only rewrites the bytes that actually
changed — usually just the four operand bytes, since `k` and `ctrl` are constant across a whole block.

### Executing and reading back

A rising edge on `uio_in[4]` (`start`) launches the operation. **Every op takes 5 clocks.** Four result bytes then appear on `uo_out[7:0]`, each qualified
by `uio_out[5]` (`out_valid`), low byte first:

```
a_out[7:0]   a_out[15:8]   b_out[7:0]   b_out[15:8]
```

Values are **signed** two's complement. `uio_out[6]` (`busy`) is high from launch until the last result byte
has been presented. Poll it rather than counting clocks: the latency is uniform today, but polling keeps a
host correct if a future revision changes it. **The operand registers must not be written while `busy` is
high**: the datapath reads them directly for the whole operation rather than taking its own copy.

### Running a transform

A full forward NTT is 7 layers of 128 Cooley-Tukey butterflies — **896 operations**, with the host supplying
the twiddle *index* per block. The inverse is 896 Gentleman-Sande butterflies with the index walking down,
followed by a 256-operation scaling pass by `f = R²/128 mod q = 1441` in `FQMUL` mode.

The round trip leaves one extra Montgomery factor: `INTT(NTT(f)) ≡ f·R (mod q)`. One `FQMUL(x, 1)` per
coefficient removes it.

Polynomial multiplication is `INTT(basemul(NTT(a), NTT(b)))`, composed from `FQMUL`, `ZMUL` and `ADD`.

### The tests

```sh
cd test
make                      # pin-level: all six ops, a full NTT, a round trip, basemul
make -f Makefile_bf       # the six-operation datapath over both reductions
make -f Makefile_fq       # the pipelined multiply and its Montgomery reduction
make -f Makefile_bar      # Barrett, over all 65,536 inputs
make -f Makefile_rom      # all 128 twiddle entries
python ntt_golden.py      # the model's own self-tests
```

Barrett's input space is one 16-bit word, so it is tested **completely** — all 65,536 values, which matters
because Theorem 6.2 is stated for `|a| < 2¹⁵` and `a = -32768` sits exactly on that boundary.

Several checks avoid the golden model entirely: `NTT(1)` must be `(1,0)` at every one of the 128 quadratic
factors (the CRT definition), `GS` must undo `CT` to give `2a`, each ROM entry is recomputed from
`centre(17^brv7(k)·R mod q)` inside its own test, and `test_both_reductions_are_present` requires Montgomery
and Barrett to give *different* answers related by exactly `R⁻¹` — which fails if one is quietly standing in
for the other.

## External hardware

An **FPGA or MCU** to hold the polynomial and drive the transform — for this project an **Arty A7-100T**.

Per butterfly the host reads `r[j]` and `r[j+len]`, writes the operand bytes that changed, pulses `start`, and
writes the two result halves back. It tracks the twiddle *index* `k`, which FIPS 203 already defines, and never
needs the table itself. A working reference implementation of exactly that sequencing is in `test/test.py`.
