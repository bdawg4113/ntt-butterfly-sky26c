//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Both reductions, and the division of labour between them
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Montgomery and Barrett are not alternatives here; each does the job the other
// is bad at, exactly as the textbook sets out.
//
// MONTGOMERY after every multiply, because a multiply is where the R
// bookkeeping is free: the twiddle carries a factor R, the product cancels it,
// and the reduction costs two constant multiplies that ride inside the
// multiplier's own pipeline.
//
// BARRETT after chains of additions, where no R factor is involved and the
// value simply needs to come back into range. Gentleman-Sande adds a and b
// every layer with no multiply on that path, so without a reducer the sum grows
// layer over layer until it overflows the 16-bit datapath. Barrett pulls it
// back to (-q/2, q/2] and introduces no Montgomery factor while doing it.
//
// The alternative -- reusing fqmul with the constant R mod q to do range
// reduction -- is arithmetically sound and was what an earlier revision did.
// It costs a second pass through the multiplier for every GS butterfly,
// doubling the inverse transform's multiply count. A dedicated Barrett unit
// buys that back: GS needs one multiply, not two, and the add and the multiply
// happen in parallel rather than in sequence.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Why Barrett is pipelined, and why every op takes five clocks
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// An earlier revision left barrett_reduce purely combinational so that the
// BARRETT and ADD ops could answer in zero clocks. Post-layout timing rejected
// it: the worst path ran from the op register, through the mux that picks
// Barrett's input, through the whole reduction -- a*v, the rounding add, the
// shift, t*q, the subtract -- and on through the output mux into the caller's
// result register. 22.33 ns of arrival against 20.82 ns required, a violation
// of 1.51 ns at the slow corner across 58 endpoints, every one of them starting
// at op[2].
//
// The zero latency was never worth anything. The caller holds a, b and op still
// for the whole operation, so Barrett already had three clocks to settle and
// was using one of them. It is now pipelined between two registers -- see the
// breakdown at the reducer itself, which explains why one register was not
// enough.
//
// So every op now takes exactly 5 clocks. That also removes a special case from
// the caller: there is one latency, not two, and out_valid means the same thing
// for all six operations. The byte-serial interface needs four write cycles and
// four read cycles per operation anyway, so five clocks against zero is noise.
//
//   cycle 0   in_valid: bar_in_r and fqmul's operand registers latch
//   cycle 1   barrett stage 1; fqmul stage 1 (two half products)
//   cycle 2   barrett stage 2; fqmul stage 2 (recombine)
//   cycle 3   bar_r latches the finished reduction; fqmul stage 3
//   cycle 4   fqmul stage 4 -- t lands at the end
//   cycle 5   out_valid: a_out and b_out select between t, bar_r and one adder
//
// a, b and zeta must hold steady from in_valid until out_valid: the outputs are
// read live from them rather than from a delay chain, which saves 32 flip-flops
// and costs nothing, because the caller holds them in its operand registers
// anyway.
